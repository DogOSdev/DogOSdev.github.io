            Welcome to DogOS! You should be viewing this in the web browser in DogOS!<br>
            If so, thank you for checking out DogOS!<br>
            You may see that this is just a basic HTML page, usually found in what we call <i>Web 1.0</i>.<br>
            DogOS can parse HTML 2.0, which is very limited on what it can do.<br>
            I did not want to make a HTML 5 parser, which would just be too large and would take more time.<br>
            So, enjoy viewing the old web!<br><br>
            <i>p.s. if you try to view a modern site that is above HTML 2, you will just get a error message.</i>
